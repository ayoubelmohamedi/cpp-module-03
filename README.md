# C++ Module 03 - Inheritance

## Description
This repository contains exercises that demonstrate the concept of inheritance in C++. Inheritance is a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming that allows the creation of a new class based on an existing class.

## Exercise 1 - Basic Inheritance
In this exercise, we introduce the concept of basic inheritance. A base class is created, and a derived class inherits from it. The derived class can access and use the members of the base class.

### Concepts Covered
- Defining a base class
- Creating a derived class
- Accessing base class members from the derived class

## Exercise 2 - Multiple Inheritance
This exercise covers multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one base class. We demonstrate how to manage multiple inheritance and resolve potential conflicts.

### Concepts Covered
- Defining multiple base classes
- Creating a derived class that inherits from multiple base classes
- Resolving conflicts in multiple inheritance

## Exercise 3 - Polymorphism
In the final exercise, we explore polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. We use virtual functions to achieve polymorphism.

### Concepts Covered
- Defining virtual functions in the base class
- Overriding virtual functions in the derived class
- Using pointers and references to achieve polymorphism

## Installation
To compile and run the exercises in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler. You can use g++ which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection.

On Ubuntu, you can install g++ with:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++
